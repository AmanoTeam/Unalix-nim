doAssert result == "https://deezer.com/track/891177062"
```

unalix --url 'https://deezer.com/track/891177062?utm_source=deezer'

#### Contributing

If you have discovered a bug in this library and know how to fix it, fork this repository and open a Pull Request.

If you found a URL that was not fully cleaned by Unalix (e.g. some tracking fields still remains), report them here or in the [ClearURLs rules repository](https://gitlab.com/anti-tracking/ClearURLs/rules/-/issues). We use the list of regex rules maintained by the ClearURLs maintainers, but we also have our [own list](https://github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix/blob/master/unalix/package_data/rulesets/unalix.json).
