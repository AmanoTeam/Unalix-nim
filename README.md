Unalix is a library and CLI tool written in Nim, it follows the same specification used by the [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) addon for removing tracking fields from URLs.

#### Installation

Install using `nimble`:

```bash
nimble install --accept 'unalix'
```

_**Note**: Unalix requires Nim 1.4.0 or higher._

#### Usage:

Removing tracking fields:

```nim
import unalix

const url: string = "https://deezer.com/track/891177062?utm_source=deezer"
let result: string = clearUrl(url = url)

assert result == "https://deezer.com/track/891177062"
```

Unshort shortened URL:

```nim
import unalix

const url: string = "https://bitly.is/Pricing-Pop-Up"
let result: string = unshortUrl(url = url)

assert result == "https://bitly.com/pages/pricing"
```

_**Tip**: The `unshortUrl()` proc will strip tracking fields from any URL before following a redirect, so you don't need to manually call `clear_url()` for it's return value._
