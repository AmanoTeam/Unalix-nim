Unalix is a small, dependency-free, fast Nim package (and CLI tool) that implements the same regex rule processing mechanism used by the [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) addon.

This is a Nim port from [Unalix](https://github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix). Python package

#### Installation

Install using `nimble`:

```bash
$ nimble install --accept \
    'git://github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix-nim'
```

#### Library usage:

Removing tracking fields:

```nim
import unalix/core/url_cleaner

const url: string = "https://deezer.com/track/891177062?utm_source=deezer"
let result: string = clearUrl(url)

echo result
```

Unshort shortened URL:

```nim
import unalix/core/url_unshort

const url: string = "https://bitly.is/Pricing-Pop-Up"
let result: string = unshortUrl(url)

echo result
```

Output from both examples:

```
https://deezer.com/track/891177062
https://bitly.com/pages/pricing
```

#### CLI usage:

```bash
$ unalix --unshort << heredoc
https://deezer.com/track/891177062?utm_source=deezer
https://bitly.is/Pricing-Pop-Up
heredoc
```

Output:

```
https://deezer.com/track/891177062
https://bitly.com/pages/pricing
```

#### Contributing

If you have discovered a bug in this library and know how to fix it, fork this repository and open a Pull Request.

If you found a URL that was not fully cleaned by Unalix (e.g. some tracking fields still remains), report them here or in the [ClearURLs rules repository](https://gitlab.com/anti-tracking/ClearURLs/rules/-/issues). We use the list of regex rules maintained by the ClearURLs maintainers, but we also have our [own list](https://github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix/blob/master/unalix/package_data/rulesets/unalix.json).
